# Roadmap Overview

Three delivery horizons, ordered by user value and implementation effort.

---

## Horizon 1 — Quick Wins (Weeks 1–4)

These items unblock everything else. All are low-risk, high-impact, and build on existing infrastructure.

| # | Feature | Why Now | Effort |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Global Toast Notification System** | Foundation for all feedback improvements. Required before any UI polish work. | XS |
| 2 | **Booking Request Confirmation Screen** | Highest-value UX gap. Silent modal-close destroys user confidence. | S |
| 3 | **Resend Verification Email** | Removes a documented drop-off point in the onboarding funnel. | XS |
| 4 | **Worker Online/Active Status** | Green dot on browse cards. Drives urgency; helps clients choose who to contact. | S |
| 5 | **Read Receipts in Messages** | Signals that messages are delivered and seen. Reduces repeat messages. | S |

---

## Horizon 2 — Core Product Growth (Months 1–3)

Trust-building and retention features. Each one increases the lifetime value of both workers and clients.

| # | Feature | Why Now | Effort |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 6 | **Reviews & Ratings System** | The primary trust engine. Converts first-time clients into repeat clients. | L |
| 7 | **Worker Availability Calendar** | Replaces basic available/busy toggle. Reduces cancellations significantly. | M |
| 8 | **Push Notifications (Web Push)** | Workers need alerts when booking requests arrive. Critical for response time. | M |
| 9 | **Saved / Favourited Workers** | Heart-save for clients. Increases return visits. Requires only client-side storage initially. | S |
| 10 | **In-App Payment Method Display** | Structured field for preferred payment method (shown privately to confirmed clients). | S |
| 11 | **Profile Share Link** | `shub.nz/w/[handle]` — workers can market themselves externally. Drives organic acquisition. | S |

---

## Horizon 3 — Platform Maturity (Months 3–6)

Revenue and scale features. Build these once the core product has proven retention.

| # | Feature | Why Now | Effort |
|---|---------|---------|--------|
| 12 | **Worker Subscription Tiers** | Revenue model. Free: basic listing. Premium: featured placement, analytics. | XL |
| 13 | **Analytics Dashboard for Workers** | Profile views, conversion rate, response rate. Workers who understand their data perform better. | L |
| 14 | **Client Verification (Optional)** | Clients can verify identity. Workers can filter for verified-only clients. Major safety upgrade. | M |
| 15 | **PWA / Mobile App** | Install prompt + push notifications + camera access. Dramatically improves mobile experience. | XL |
